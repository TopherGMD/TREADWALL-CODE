# Replacement Motor Control

```sh
Well It finally happened.
On 2021/04/05, the electronics on the control board stopped functioning.  

I'll now be looking to replace the DC motor controllers.  
I'll start with the speed control motor, If I can get that working, I'll proceed to the incline motor.  

What do I know about the speed motor?
it's a Leeson brand Direct Current Permement Magnet Motor.  
RPM 1750
Volts 90
Amps 5
Duty Continuous
Torque 18.0  Inch/Lbs. 
Horse Power: 1/2 


5 mins of searching the web brings up this controller:
[Omega OMDC-130LC100] DC Motor Speed Control with Reversing Capability

To change directions, I would need a [relay], like this one.
